        <p>A key rule at EDA is to not plagiarize another's work so I would like to credit the design of this blog to <a href="http://html5up.net">html5up.net</a>. As I was a latecomer to the course I have decided to use there design for the blog template so I might save the time I would have put into making my own and put it into writing up the blog entries.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://www.instructables.com/" target="blank">Instructables</a>
            </h3>
            <p>I love this site. Of all sites I enjoy coming to this the most. It is a website of peoples projects, mostly physical, but often tech based as well. It is mostly people identifying problems and showcasing there solutions. I feel truly inspired by what I see people are making and find myself always fascinated by certain ideas:</p>
            <img class="img_right" src="images/robot.jpg" alt="Instructables Robot">
            <ul>

                </p>
            </ul>
            <p>On the Home page my eye is immediately drawn to the words "Let's Make" and the blinking cursor waiting for you to type something in. This is the search field of the site so seems appropriate that your eye is drawn to it.</p>
            <p>The site is easy to navigate, once you have searched for something it presents a page of tiled instructables that matched your search. the search box is a little smaller but still centre stage so one can fine tune their search. once looking at an instructable then the search box is in the nav bar to the top right. This structure works well as it is a site for searching, there are other links to profile and contests in the top nav bar, but 90% of the time you are just searching.</p>
            <p>I would describe the sites content as:</p>
            <ul class="horizontal_list">
                <p><b>Fun</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Creative</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Hacking</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Inspiring</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Mostly complicated</b>
                </p>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>I would describe the site visually as:</p>
            <ul class="horizontal_list">
                <p><b>Fun</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Accessible</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Hopeful</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Consistent</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Understandable</b>
                </p>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <p>Instructables has several revenue streams, including pro accounts (you get to download pdfs of instructions), advertising, business partnerships (eg autodesk) and partner promotion. None of which I have bought/done.</p>
            <p>When I finish browsing Instructables i just wanna make something and often go into the garage and start mucking around with one of projects that litter the work benches like dead flies.</p>

        <!-- Trademe -->
        <section>
            <h3><a href="http://www.trademe.co.nz/" target="blank">Trademe</a>
            </h3>
            <p>I can't help it, I love Trademe. Finding a bargain, buying second hand (better for the environment) and the opportunity to get things you have never heard of. I like browsing through and seeing what other people are attracted to, what there not and comparing that to myself. I believe Trademe facilitates a need of society to trade unwanted/no longer needed items around. It does so very efficiently and has caused many traditional trading shops to close down or become more niche.</p>
            <img class="img_right" src="images/trademe.png" alt="Trademe Kiwi">

            <p>On the Home page my eye is drawn to the "New or Used?" link. I was surprised by this, but after looking at the visual configuration not surprised; everything is shades of grey and dark blue except for the search bar and this little question slightly off centre to the right below. Interestingly it links through to a comparative site where you can search for an item and see a side by side price comparison of the “new” and “used” results. This is prime territory for allowing people to convince themselves to buy something, either its "look how much money i save buying used" or "look for only a little more I can buy it new". In both cases it is to "assist" people in making a purchase decision. Personally I have never used it, but its what caught my eye visually.</p>
            <p>Trademe appeals to the second hand trader but over the years the catalogue has become cluttered with "new" item listings often with 10 or more identical listings. This degrades the user experience</p>
            <p>Navigability is ok, one can do a search and then apply filters to the results eg category, sort-by and location, or one can browse by category and then apply filters. It is also not as clear as it could be, you kind off have to work it out. I think this is done on purpose so traders feel a sense of accomplishment for finding something, I am not convinced it works, but that's the intention.</p>
            <p>I would describe the sites content as:</p>
            <ul class="horizontal_list">
                <p><b>Confusing</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Opportunities</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Cluttered</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Repetitive</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Suggestive</b>
                </p>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>I would describe the site visually as:</p>
            <ul class="horizontal_list">
                <p><b>Mainstream</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Boring</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Hierarchical</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Manipulative</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>hanging out in white space</b>
                </p>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Trademe makes its money by charging its users for listing items on its site. I have bought numerous items over the years and if I think upon just the true bargains I have got I have saved several thousand dollars.</p>
            <p>However when i finish browsing Trademe I generally feel mild annoyance that I didn't get what I wanted as it went over my self set price threshold - generally rrp/3</p>

        <!-- Coursera -->
        <section>
            <h3><a href="http://www.coursera.com/" target="blank">Coursera</a>
            </h3>
            <p>I came across Coursera a year ago, it is a MOOC platform - Mass On-line Open Course. Typically the courses available are backed by a university and based on the universities curriculum. The last course i did was on gamification, it had 150,000ca students and basically we each did our work and then peer assessed each other.</p>
            <img class="img_right" src="images/coursera.png" alt="Trademe Kiwi">

            <p>On Home page my eye was drawn to the images of six featured courses. Once I have realized they are not for me I see the search box and want to enter something into it. I feel that this is good design as it means that users will be viewing the promoted courses of Coursers before looking into their personal preference. This is a symbiotic benefit to the user and Coursera as the user is exposed to course opportunities they may not other wise have looked for and Coursera have the opportunity to promote a course of there choice.</p>
            <p>Coursera extends the reach of universities beyond the class room walls, it is a progressive technology that is looking at decentralized peer-peer education to horizontally scale up the number of students and educators. By marrying an on-line course with a real world facilitator a group of people can learn very rapidly without as much time resource investment from the facilitator as would otherwise have to happen. I believe that this process allows for humanity to horizontally scale out our knowledge bank rather then the vertical scale model which is currently prevalent. ie kindergarten -> school -> high school -> college/undergraduate degree -> masters -> doctorate -> professor.</p>

            <p>Navigation is simple, after the landing page you interact with a search page and then a course page when you click on a course. The search page has a simple list of parameters/ filters to the left to refine your results. The course pages are simple no nonsense info pages with a sign up option. It is intuitive and to the point.</p>
            <p>I would describe the sites content as:</p>
            <ul class="horizontal_list">
                <p><b>Clear</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Informative</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Organised</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Literal</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Practical</b>
                </p>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>I would describe the site visually as:</p>
            <ul class="horizontal_list">
                <p><b>Simple</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Clear</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Composed</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Passive</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Helpful</b>
                </p>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Coursera offers students the option to buy verified completion certificates for the courses they do. Interestingly this is very symbiotic as Coursera get to make some money while users who have invested in the course are more likely to complete the course as they have invested in it.</p>
            <p>I have not bought a verified certificate yet though I will in the future.</p>
            <p>I would suggest everyone on the EDA course have a look at the course in logic at some point, it will help you pseudo code.</p>

            <h2>EDA culture and Me</h2>
        </header>
        <section>
            <header>
                <h3>Reflections after watching <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014" target="blank">Fireside Chat with Shereef: Kitchen vs. Table</a>
                </h3>
            </header>
            <p>My impression of the EDA culture is that it is a collaborative place for people with a like minded goal: To learn and learn in the way they want. It reminds me of my years at Raphael House Rudolf Steiner School in Lower Hutt, New Zealand; especially the younger years. All classes were mandatory and your class of about 20±5 students generally banded together and did the work as a group. If there was a problem, then it was a group problem that required the group to do activities to remedy the it. e.g. making new students have it hard, they are the outsider. I know I was one.</p>

            <p>One of the reasons I bonded with my classmates was we were sent on hard camps, the hardest I remember was hiking up My Ruapehu, across and up Ngauruhoe (Mt Doom) and then across the Tongariro crossing in five days. Well it was incredible and HARD, your exhausted all the time, but you know there's all these moments where you help each other; someone twists there ankle and the rest of you distribute there pack items amongst you, someone else's foods ruined by weather so the rest of you eat less and share what you have or another's tent is wrecked by the wind - well you wont be cold with extra bodies that are now in your tent.</p>

            <div class="inner gallery">
                <a href="images/national park.jpg">
                    <img src="images/national park.jpg" class="img_right" Title="Tongariro National Park">
                </a>
            </div>
            <p>A second comparison I can give is the ten days I spent on the <a href="http://www.spiritofadventure.org.nz/">Spirit on New Zealand</a> a beautiful tall mast ship lovingly maintained for youth to develop qualities of leadership, independence and community spirit. The voyage I was on was in the middle of the winter and my strongest memory was having to jump into the water every morning at 0600 and swim the length of the boat and climb up a cargo net, then run a few laps of the deck and then do some start jumps for good measure. However again it wasn't the actual hardships that brought the group together, but the small offers of help that people very quickly started offering to each other. The opportunities to bond while peeling 40kgs of potatos, guiding someone less confident then yourself up the rigging and laughing together.</p>

            <p>So Shereef's vision of EDA, in my opinion, is to create a place where people may come together and form a cohort and together work together towards improving ourselves. There is a heavy emphasis on culture and learning methodology of EDA because Shereef identified that these two things were the most common barriers to getting the most out of dev boot camp. I also think the emphasis on pairing in phase 0 is trying to help us get to the point where we don't have barriers to giving out help and receiving it. Fostering kindness.</p>

            <p>After watching Fireside Chat and reflecting on it, my expectations for EDA have changed. They have gone higher, I feel more empowered to truly be myself and reach as high as I can with everyone else with me. I am not in the least bit nervous - in fact I feel great knowing that we will be in it together.</p>

            <p>In sword play you have to go to a position of poor structure in order to then move in a new direction. That is to say poor structure is a strong move for change.</p>

            </header>
            <p>Trademe provides a good example of a site where the visual composition is very cluttered, with differing scales of elements. There are so many choices in the top left hand area that you never look at anything else. The big white space to right was originally full of adds but Ad block+ got rid of them for me.</p>

            <h2>Responsive design: Fad or Best Practice? </h2>
        </header>
        <section>
            <header>
                <h3>The advent of a large range of screen sizes and aspect ratios on devices has forced the web world to rethink what a website is.</h3>
            </header>
            <p>Six years ago I made my first website, it was hacked together and used iframes and floats to try and change the user experience. I wanted to do away with the website flashing white every time a link was clicked and only looking good on 15 inch monitors. I wanted the sites I built to persist and be slick - I wanted them to be webapps (but didn't know it). At about this time the iPhone hit the world like a knock-out punch and it reaffirmed my stand. I developed a site from scratch (no templates) and then struggled to force I to do my bidding. It ended up being such a hack, it used a large seamless iframe that the floated links along the bottom left and right targeted. This was before HTML% and CSS3 so my interpretation of Responsive design was to massively reduce and simplify down to just three elements. Most of the content for the iframe were galleries that used JavaScript that could target the whole page and thereby break free of the iframe when the maximise button was clicked.</p>

            <p>What a mess! Made worse by the obsession with getting an app out there, which was because websites just didn't look good on these emerging platforms. Designers evolved and did the most obvious thing they could - make mobile specific websites - More Mess! multiple code sets to manage and develop! The irony was that a lot of the "apps" were just mobile sites running on a browser with a new skin. Then along came sanity in the form of responsive design, I first saw it in an early release of HTML5 Boilerplate. It was like a deep calming breath of fresh mountain air. (well that's probably a little over described, oh well)</p>

            <div class="inner gallery">
                <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">
                    <img src="images/html5_boilerplate.jpeg" class="img_right" Title="HTML5 Boilerplate">
                </a>
            </div>

            <p>Responsive design is a rational approach to what a website need to now be, in short it is structuring your website in a manner that allows for it to morph to suit the screen size and aspect ratio. This added complexity typically means that the overall design of the site is simplified to the reduce the number of elements that needed to be made to respond. However this goes hand in hand with a trend for people to want to look at leaner less noisy websites. But that is not to say you cant be creative, responsiveness can lead to creative opportunities.</p>

                <h3>What is the point of a web of knowledge if it does not deliver to every person who wants to know.</h3>
            </header>
            <p>Visually impaired people can rely on larger dpi websites, color adjusted sites, touch and sound depending on there specific need. its important that designers make sure all elements are well labelled so that other programs can interface with the structure.</p>

            <p>It is also worth noting that most visually impaired people will be able to call for assistance when needed. They are also generally less likely to go crawling through the web as it is to difficult to learn all the different navigation options out there. They will have there favourite sites and will often rely on content being forwarded into their read app of choice that they know is going to work.</p>

            <p>So where does that leave us - I think its much like responsive design, at the moment there is no mass adopted method for catering to accessibility needs. Until it is it will be a messy affair.</p>
