            <h3><a href="http://www.instructables.com/" target="blank">Instructables</a>
            </h3>
            <p>I love this site. Of all sites I enjoy coming to this the most. It is a website of peoples projects, mostly physical, but often tech based as well. It is mostly people identifying problems and showcasing there solutions. I feel truly inspired by what I see people are making and find myself always fascinated by certain ideas:</p>
            <img class="img_right" src="images/robot.jpg" alt="Instructables Robot">
            <ul>
                <p><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/A-3D-printable-Pip-Boy-3000/" target="blank ">Pipboy 3000</a>

                </p>
            </ul>
            <p>On the Home page my eye is immediately drawn to the words "Let's Make" and the blinking cursor waiting for you to type something in. This is the search field of the site so seems appropriate that your eye is drawn to it.</p>
            <p>The site is easy to navigate, once you have searched for something it presents a page of tiled instructables that matched your search. the search box is a little smaller but still centre stage so one can fine tune their search. once looking at an instructable then the search box is in the nav bar to the top right. This structure works well as it is a site for searching, there are other links to profile and contests in the top nav bar, but 90% of the time you are just searching.</p>
            <p>I would describe the sites content as:</p>
            <ul class="horizontal_list">
                <p><b>Fun</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Creative</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Hacking</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Inspiring</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Mostly complicated</b>
                </p>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>I would describe the site visually as:</p>
            <ul class="horizontal_list">
                <p><b>Fun</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Accessible</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Hopeful</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Consistent</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Understandable</b>
                </p>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <p>Instructables has several revenue streams, including pro accounts (you get to download pdfs of instructions), advertising, business partnerships (eg autodesk) and partner promotion. None of which I have bought/done.</p>
            <p>When I finish browsing Instructables i just wanna make something and often go into the garage and start mucking around with one of projects that litter the work benches like dead flies.</p>

        <!-- Trademe -->
        <section>
            <h3><a href="http://www.trademe.co.nz/" target="blank">Trademe</a>
            </h3>
            <p>I can't help it, I love Trademe. Finding a bargain, buying second hand (better for the environment) and the opportunity to get things you have never heard of. I like browsing through and seeing what other people are attracted to, what there not and comparing that to myself. I believe Trademe facilitates a need of society to trade unwanted/no longer needed items around. It does so very efficiently and has caused many traditional trading shops to close down or become more niche.</p>
            <img class="img_right" src="images/trademe.png" alt="Trademe Kiwi">

            <p>On the Home page my eye is drawn to the "New or Used?" link. I was surprised by this, but after looking at the visual configuration not surprised; everything is shades of grey and dark blue except for the search bar and this little question slightly off centre to the right below. Interestingly it links through to a comparative site where you can search for an item and see a side by side price comparison of the “new” and “used” results. This is prime territory for allowing people to convince themselves to buy something, either its "look how much money i save buying used" or "look for only a little more I can buy it new". In both cases it is to "assist" people in making a purchase decision. Personally I have never used it, but its what caught my eye visually.</p>
            <p>Trademe appeals to the second hand trader but over the years the catalogue has become cluttered with "new" item listings often with 10 or more identical listings. This degrades the user experience</p>
            <p>Navigability is ok, one can do a search and then apply filters to the results eg category, sort-by and location, or one can browse by category and then apply filters. It is also not as clear as it could be, you kind off have to work it out. I think this is done on purpose so traders feel a sense of accomplishment for finding something, I am not convinced it works, but that's the intention.</p>
            <p>I would describe the sites content as:</p>
            <ul class="horizontal_list">
                <p><b>Confusing</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Opportunities</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Cluttered</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Repetitive</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Suggestive</b>
                </p>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>I would describe the site visually as:</p>
            <ul class="horizontal_list">
                <p><b>Mainstream</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Boring</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Hierarchical</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Manipulative</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Hanging</b>
                </p>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Trademe makes its money by charging its users for listing items on its site. I have bought numerous items over the years and if I think upon just the true bargains I have got I have saved several thousand dollars.</p>
            <p>However when i finish browsing Trademe I generally feel mild annoyance that I didn't get what I wanted as it went over my self set price threshold - generally rrp/3</p>

        <!-- Coursera -->
        <section>
            <h3><a href="http://www.coursera.com/" target="blank">Coursera</a>
            </h3>
            <p>I came across Coursera a year ago, it is a MOOC platform - Mass On-line Open Course. Typically the courses available are backed by a university and based on the universities curriculum. The last course i did was on gamification, it had 150,000ca students and basically we each did our work and then peer assessed each other.</p>
            <img class="img_right" src="images/coursera.png" alt="Trademe Kiwi">

            <p>On Home page my eye was drawn to the images of six featured courses. Once I have realized they are not for me I see the search box and want to enter something into it. I feel that this is good design as it means that users will be viewing the promoted courses of Coursers before looking into their personal preference. This is a symbiotic benefit to the user and Coursera as the user is exposed to course opportunities they may not other wise have looked for and Coursera have the opportunity to promote a course of there choice.</p>
            <p>Coursera extends the reach of universities beyond the class room walls, it is a progressive technology that is looking at decentralized peer-peer education to horizontally scale up the number of students and educators. By marrying an on-line course with a real world facilitator a group of people can learn very rapidly without as much time resource investment from the facilitator as would otherwise have to happen. I believe that this process allows for humanity to horizontally scale out our knowledge bank rather then the vertical scale model which is currently prevalent. ie kindergarten -> school -> high school -> college/undergraduate degree -> masters -> doctorate -> professor.</p>

            <p>Navigation is simple, after the landing page you interact with a search page and then a course page when you click on a course. The search page has a simple list of parameters/ filters to the left to refine your results. The course pages are simple no nonsense info pages with a sign up option. It is intuitive and to the point.</p>
            <p>I would describe the sites content as:</p>
            <ul class="horizontal_list">
                <p><b>Clear</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Informative</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Organised</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Literal</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Practical</b>
                </p>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>I would describe the site visually as:</p>
            <ul class="horizontal_list">
                <p><b>Simple</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Clear</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Composed</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Passive</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Helpful</b>
                </p>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Coursera offers students the option to buy verified completion certificates for the courses they do. Interestingly this is very symbiotic as Coursera get to make some money while users who have invested in the course are more likely to complete the course as they have invested in it.</p>
            <p>I have not bought a verified certificate yet though I will in the future.</p>
            <p>I would suggest everyone on the EDA course have a look at the course in logic at some point, it will help you pseudo code.</p>

            <header>
                <h3>Reflections after watching <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014" target="blank">Fireside Chat with Shereef: Kitchen vs. Table</a>
                </h3>
            </header>
            <p>My impression of the EDA culture is that it is a collaborative place for people with a like minded goal: To learn and learn in the way they want. It reminds me of my years at Raphael House Rudolf Steiner School in Lower Hutt, New Zealand; especially the younger years. All classes were mandatory and your class of about 20±5 students generally banded together and did the work as a group. If there was a problem, then it was a group problem that required the group to do activities to remedy the it. e.g. making new students have it hard, they are the outsider. I know I was one.</p>

            <p>One of the reasons I bonded with my classmates was we were sent on hard camps, the hardest I remember was hiking up My Ruapehu, across and up Ngauruhoe (Mt Doom) and then across the Tongariro crossing in five days. Well it was incredible and HARD, your exhausted all the time, but you know there's all these moments where you help each other; someone twists there ankle and the rest of you distribute there pack items amongst you, someone else's foods ruined by weather so the rest of you eat less and share what you have or another's tent is wrecked by the wind - well you wont be cold with extra bodies that are now in your tent.</p>

            <div class="inner picture">
                <a href="images/national park.jpg">
                    <img src="images/national park.jpg" class="img_right" Title="Tongariro National Park">
                </a>
            </div>
            <p>A second comparison I can give is the ten days I spent on the <a href="http://www.spiritofadventure.org.nz/">Spirit on New Zealand</a> a beautiful tall mast ship lovingly maintained for youth to develop qualities of leadership, independence and community spirit. The voyage I was on was in the middle of the winter and my strongest memory was having to jump into the water every morning at 0600 and swim the length of the boat and climb up a cargo net, then run a few laps of the deck and then do some start jumps for good measure. However again it wasn't the actual hardships that brought the group together, but the small offers of help that people very quickly started offering to each other. The opportunities to bond while peeling 40kgs of potatos, guiding someone less confident then yourself up the rigging and laughing together.</p>

            <p>So Shereef's vision of EDA, in my opinion, is to create a place where people may come together and form a cohort and together work together towards improving ourselves. There is a heavy emphasis on culture and learning methodology of EDA because Shereef identified that these two things were the most common barriers to getting the most out of dev boot camp. I also think the emphasis on pairing in phase 0 is trying to help us get to the point where we don't have barriers to giving out help and receiving it. Fostering kindness.</p>

            <p>After watching Fireside Chat and reflecting on it, my expectations for EDA have changed. They have gone higher, I feel more empowered to truly be myself and reach as high as I can with everyone else with me. I am not in the least bit nervous - in fact I feel great knowing that we will be in it together.</p>

            <p>In sword play you have to go to a position of poor structure in order to then move in a new direction. That is to say poor structure is a strong move for change.</p>

            <p>Trademe provides a good example of a site where the visual composition is very cluttered, with differing scales of elements. There are so many choices in the top left hand area that you never look at anything else. The big white space to right was originally full of adds but Ad block+ got rid of them for me.</p>

            <h2>Responsive design: Fad or Best Practice?</h2>
        </header>
        <section>
            <header>
                <h3>The advent of a large range of screen sizes and aspect ratios on devices has forced the web world to rethink what a website is.</h3>
            </header>
            <p>Six years ago I made my first website, it was hacked together and used iframes and floats to try and change the user experience. I wanted to do away with the website flashing white every time a link was clicked and only looking good on 15 inch monitors. I wanted the sites I built to persist and be slick - I wanted them to be webapps (but didn't know it). At about this time the iPhone hit the world like a knock-out punch and it reaffirmed my stand. I developed a site from scratch (no templates) and then struggled to force I to do my bidding. It ended up being such a hack, it used a large seamless iframe that the floated links along the bottom left and right targeted. This was before HTML% and CSS3 so my interpretation of Responsive design was to massively reduce and simplify down to just three elements. Most of the content for the iframe were galleries that used JavaScript that could target the whole page and thereby break free of the iframe when the maximise button was clicked.</p>

            <p>What a mess! Made worse by the obsession with getting an app out there, which was because websites just didn't look good on these emerging platforms. Designers evolved and did the most obvious thing they could - make mobile specific websites - More Mess! multiple code sets to manage and develop! The irony was that a lot of the "apps" were just mobile sites running on a browser with a new skin. Then along came sanity in the form of responsive design, I first saw it in an early release of <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>. It was like a deep calming breath of fresh mountain air. (well that's probably a little over described, oh well)</p>

                </a>
            </div>

            <p>Responsive design is a rational approach to what a website need to now be, in short it is structuring your website in a manner that allows for it to morph to suit the screen size and aspect ratio. This added complexity typically means that the overall design of the site is simplified to the reduce the number of elements that needed to be made to respond. However this goes hand in hand with a trend for people to want to look at leaner less noisy websites. But that is not to say you cant be creative, responsiveness can lead to creative opportunities.</p>

            </header>
            <p>Visually impaired people can rely on larger dpi websites, color adjusted sites, touch and sound depending on there specific need. its important that designers make sure all elements are well labelled so that other programs can interface with the structure.</p>

            <p>It is also worth noting that most visually impaired people will be able to call for assistance when needed. They are also generally less likely to go crawling through the web as it is to difficult to learn all the different navigation options out there. They will have there favourite sites and will often rely on content being forwarded into their read app of choice that they know is going to work.</p>

            <p>So where does that leave us - I think its much like responsive design, at the moment there is no mass adopted method for catering to accessibility needs. Until it is it will be a messy affair.</p>

                <h3>I used id's on everything when I first started writing HTML, then I started using HTML5 Boilerplate and noticed it was almost all classes - so which is right?</h3>
            </header>
            <p>In essence id's are unique descriptors of a single element where as a class descriptor will be applied to every element with that class. Elements may also have multiple classes and a page may only have one instance of that element id combination.</p>
            <p>So then I could just use classes for everything and not worry about it... In a pure HTML setting this may work, however understanding the differences will enable you do some clever things:</p>
            <ul>
                <p>Elements can have a generic class describing how it should behave, but may then have an id to describe unique properties as well.</p>
                <p>id's have a trump card, the hash value may be amended to the url to take the user to that element in the page. eg for this post https://chronicd.github.io/Blog/blog.html#tenth</p>
                <p>JavaScript cares!!! your pure HTML/CSSS site will function even if you use the class/id incorrectly, but JavaScript relies on the ability top call an unique element.</p>
                <p>Microformats are good! whenever building a commonly used structure try to do so in the industry standards MicroFormat. eg a vcard. This allows your code to interact with other software that has been designed around these standards. It also makes it a lot easier to come back to your code down the line and amend changers.</p>

            <p>The second iteration of the design simplified the ideas to a horizontal row of elements with css drop down sub-links appearing when a user hovered over them. In the mobile version the elements would be vertical and i was excited to see what I could make happen in the transition from one form to the other - effectively your mid size screens i.e. tablets. I did not mock up the transition - rather just a design parameter that it needed to be chaotic. Multiple photos in gallery!</p>

            <h2>W4 Tech Blog: Loops for iterative actions.</h2>
        </header>
        <section>
            <header>
                <h3>Loops are programs within a program, they have a function and once initiated will repeat that function until an end condition is met.</h3>
            </header>
            <p>Loops are a tool for developers to define a condition and have code run until the condition is met. It makes no sense if you were to have a condition that will never be met, in fact such a situation results in an endless loop and will crash the application running the code and sometimes the computer.</p>
            <p>A good example of a loop is where you have a starting number and want it to be manipulated until it is greater then another. eg</p>
            <p>loop start: num = 2, condition: num >= 100
                <br>code: num = num * num (here we are saying new num is equal to existing num squared)
                <br>end loop</p>
            <p><i>In C# you can create loops by using the iteration statements. Iteration statements cause embedded statements to be executed a number of times, subject to the loop-termination criteria. These statements are executed in order, except when a jump statement is encountered.</i> 
                <br>The following keywords are used in iteration statements:</p>

            <ol>
                <h2>
                    <li>do-while</li>
                    <li>for</li>
                    <li>foreach</li>
                    <li>while</li>
                    <li>nested</li>
                </h2>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>The do statement</h3>
            <p>The do statement executes a statement or a block of statements repeatedly until a specified expression evaluates to false. The body of the loop must be enclosed in braces, {}, unless it consists of a single statement. In that case, the braces are optional.</p>
            <p>Unlike the while statement, a do-while loop is executed one time before the conditional expression is evaluated. At any point in the do-while block, you can break out of the loop using the break statement. A do-while loop can also be exited by the goto, return, or throw statements.</p>

            <h3>The for statement</h3>
            <p>By using a for loop, you can run a statement or a block of statements repeatedly until a specified expression evaluates to false. This kind of loop is useful for iterating over arrays and for other applications in which you know in advance how many times you want the loop to iterate.</p>

            <h3>The foreach, in statement</h3>
            <p>The foreach statement repeats a group of embedded statements for each element in an array or an object collection. The foreach statement is used to iterate through the collection to get the information that you want, but can not be used to add or remove items from the source collection to avoid unpredictable side effects. If you need to add or remove items from the source collection, use a for loop.</p>
            <p>The embedded statements continue to execute for each element in the array or collection. After the iteration has been completed for all the elements in the collection, control is transferred to the next statement following the foreach block. A foreach loop can also be exited by the break, continue, goto, return, or throw statements.</p>

            <h3>The while statement</h3>
            <p>The while statement executes a statement or a block of statements until a specified expression evaluates to false. Because the test of the while expression takes place before each execution of the loop, a while loop executes zero or more times. This differs from the do loop, which executes one or more times</p>
            <p>A while loop can be terminated when a break, goto, return, or throw statement transfers control outside the loop. To pass control to the next iteration without exiting the loop, use the continue statement.</p>

            <h3>A nested statement</h3>
            <p>Nesting loops is placing one or more loops inside another creating a loop with loop processes in side it.</p>

            <h3>Loop Control statements</h3>
            <p>Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed. As mentioned before there are a few ways to break out of a loop. The most common are the break statement that immediately terminates the loop and executes the next statement after the loop and the continue statement that causes the remainder of the loop to be skipped and retest its condition prior to reiterating</p>

            <div class="inner picture">
                <a href="images/DLOWEcobblerFINISHblog.jpg">
                    <img src="images/DLOWEcobblerFINISHblog.jpg" class="img_right" Title="While the developer has a coffee the loopy elf works tirelessly.">
                </a>
            </div>

            <h3>But when to use what?</h3>
            <p>The loops can be divided into two types while and do-while, and for and foreach. The while loops are best used for general conditions eg for variables. The while loop condition is at the beginning of the loop so if the condition is false the loop is not initiated. Do-while has the condition at the end so the loop body will always be executed at least once. If you require the body to run at least once use a do-while loop otherwise use a while loop. An example of this would be if in the body you required user input such as an answer to yes/no then it would be tested against the condition and if the condition is met it would be escaped. Otherwise the loop would restart.</p>
            <p>The for and foreach loops are used to run a specific number of times, this is particularly suited to running on each element of an array/arrayList/hashtable/dictionary - in other words a set in which you want to change the contents. In C# the for statement provides a start point, condition to be met and an iterative declaration eg increase index by one. this means that the loop body will be applied to any element that meets the condition as it iterates through the set in the prescribed way. The foreach statement declares a type of element in a defined set and then iterates through applying the code to each such element. So if you find yourself wanting to apply changes to only some elements of a set use the for statement otherwise use the foreach statement to effect them all.</p>

                <h3>Technology adoption has for millennia been limited by economics and politics, now for the first time technology is trying to change this.</h3>
            </header>
            <p>Technology may be seen as the educated application of human creativity and logical problem solving. The degree of development a technology will have is dependent on the availability of these three factors. That is to say creative and logical thinkers that have knowledge or access to knowledge to inform their designs.</p>

            <h3>the twofold problem</h3>
            <p>Firstly poor economic situations and political motivations in many countries mean access to modern telecommunication technology is haphazard. Secondly the usability of the technology is very poor, the technologies are generally not intuitive and only recently with smart phones and tablets has there been a push to change this. These could be summarized as a lack of availability of technology to access knowledge.</p>

                </a>
            </div>

            <p>The lack of availability results in less creative logical thinkers and limits those that do come about in the knowledge available to them for future technological development. However it is not all doom and gloom, there are many movements in many places to try and change this, it is such a big problem that the logical thing is to break it down into smaller more manageable chunks. EDA is such an entity, it identified a problem "there aren't enough creative logical thinkers out there and set about devising a system and give access to knowledge to produce more (and give them some other core skills).</p>
            <br>
            <p>My observations of EDA have synergised with my own conviction that technology will provide the solutions we need going forward. Because modern technology is starting to develop beyond the constraints that limited its availability to people across the world. It gains momentum, almost as if it is evolving. In a way it is evolving as all its cells, the creative logical thinkers find problems and make solutions for them. In my opinion the future is uncertain, but the path that will give us clarity is through our evolving technologies.</p>

            <h2>W5 Tech Blog:  What, When, Why and How to use Classes</h2>
        </header>

            <header>
                <h3>A developer writing classes is like Batman making a utility belt</h3>
            </header>
            <h3>I love LEGO</h3>
            <p>I grew up playing with a lot of LEGO and the best thing about getting a new LEGO kit was working out how to put it together following the pictographic instructions. The instructions would describe how to put together various parts of the kit from the provided blocks and at the end tell you how to put the parts together to make the whole object. Then you would pass it your brother only to be dismayed as it was promptly destroyed — but secretly excited at the prospect of putting it back together.</p>

            <h3>Classes and LEGO</h3>
            <p>Classes can be likened to the instructions provided in a LEGO kit, inside the instructions are various methods that explain how to assemble parts from the building blocks which could be likened to data. It is a simple analogy but it illustrates that a class is just a set of instructions that can be used.big</p>

            <div class="inner picture">

                    <img src="images/toys_02.jpg" class="img_right" Title="Some simple LEGO instructions for an engine">
                </a>
            </div>

            <h3>When its classy</h3>
            <p>Generally i would say that creating classes is good practice, even in a simple application as it divides up the code into parts making it easier to manage and develop on. In more complex solutions it will allow for better organisation of the various functions and allow the work to be shared amongst developers more easily. If the classes are generic enough they may be used in multiple locations. This is particularly common with manipulating data where you want to apply similar logic to different data sets. Reading online i found  this article rather insightful <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/22769/Introduction-to-Object-Oriented-Programming-Concep#identify">4.6 How to identify and design a class</a>. It states that classes should be made when code:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>SRP - The Single Responsibility Principle - 
A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.</li>
                <li>OCP - The Open Closed Principle - 
You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it.</li>
                <li>LSP - The Liskov Substitution Principle- 
Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.</li>
                <li>DIP - The Dependency Inversion Principle- 
Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.</li>
                <li>ISP - The Interface Segregation Principle- 
Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Seems like extra work</h3>
            <p>Building classes feels like making something more complex as its placing functions in different locations. However it give the developer the power to compartmentalize the various routines being built and though the first time we think on a problem we think in a linear fashion, that is only because it is the easiest way. Keeping many different sources as inputs into a program in a cognitive model is harder then having it in a singular narrative thread.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Being Classy</h3>
            <p>Classes are declared using the class keyword, they also have a access level and className.</p>
            <p>public class className { <i>contents of class</i> }</p>
            <p>Objects are then declared as instances of classes, this includes methods.</p>
            <p>className newObject = new className</p>
            <p>Classes may be inherited by appending a colon after the class name declaring the class to inherit from</p>
            <p>public class Manager : Employee { <i>contents of class</i> }</p>
            <br>
            <p>So in short its Classy to use classes — and you will be like Batman!</p>
