            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>My first formal introduction to design thinking was at university where i studied building architecture. I remember struggling with the way they explained it to me, it was alkmoest that while focusing on how designing the curriculum they had forgotton to design how they would teach design. Or perhaps they had and i just didnt see it.</p>
            <p>Over the preceding years i started to grasp the concept and intuitively solved problems/overcame challanges using a design methodology. I started to describe myself as a problem solver, that is if you can define a problem then I can design the solution, gaining any competencies and knowledge I needed along the way.</p>

            <h2>The concept</h2>
            <p>Design thinking has come to be defined as combining empathy for the context of a problem, creativity in the generation of insights and solutions, and rationality in analyzing and fitting various solutions to the problem context.[2] According to Tim Brown, CEO and president of IDEO, the goal of Design Thinking is "matching peopleâ€™s needs with what is technologically feasible and viable as a business strategy"</p>

            <h2>Solution based thinking</h2>
            <p>Design thinking is a formal method for practical, creative resolution of problems or issues, with the intent of an improved future result. In this regard it is a form of solution-based, or solution-focused thinking which starts with a goal (a better future situation) instead of solving one specific problem. By considering both the present and future conditions, the parameters of the problem, and possible solutions, may be explored simultaneously. Cross asserted that this type of thinking most often happens in the built, or artificial, environment (as in artifacts).</p>

            <p>This approach differs from the scientific method, which begins with thoroughly defining all the parameters of the problem in order to create a solution. Design thinking starts without preconceived problem definitions and solutions, in order to discover hidden parameters and alternate optimized paths to the goal. Because Design Thinking is also iterative, any solutions are also potential new starting points for future phases.</p>

        <article id="A3">
            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p>Design thinking is a process which includes the "building up" of ideas, with few, or no, limits on breadth during a "brainstorming" phase. This helps reduce fear of failure in the participant(s) and encourages input and participation from a wide variety of sources in the ideation phases.</p>
